### Item03 Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type
The main advantage of the public field approach is that the API makes it clear that the class is a singleton: 
the public static field is final, so it will always contain the same object reference. 
The second advantage is that itâ€™s simpler.

One advantage of the static factory approach is that 
it gives you the flexibility to change your mind about whether the class is a singleton without changing its API. 
The factory method returns the sole instance, but it could be modified to return, say, a separate instance foreach thread that invokes it. 
A second advantage is that you can write a generic singleton factory if your application requires it(Item 30). 
A final advantage of using a static factory is that a method reference can be used as a supplier, for example Elvis::instance is a Supplier<Elvis>. 
Unless one of these advantages is relevant, the public field approach is preferable.
